                        <p>1) What went well? Key Learning.</p>
                        <p>So far, understanding how html is structured is the key learning for me. Being able to create a web page out of code and then actually see what it looks like is very satisfying.</p>

                        <p>2) What could have been improved?</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the explanation and direction on how css is linked to html and how to link it was very vague and glossed over as I still don't understand the concept behind it.</p>
                        </p>

                        <p>3) The key take aways.</p>
                        <p>This would have to be learning the process of creating blogs and a website that are truly basic through repositories and also building code using platforms like visual code.</p>

                        <p>4) The process you followed?</p>
                        <p>I followed the process outlined in the tutorial supplied by Academy X and also applied some other processes from google searches.</p>
